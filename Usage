Currently takes one option when initialised, :group. This allows you 
to specify the group under which your logs appear - see 
"Nested grouping" at http://getfirebug.com/logging.html for an example.

To log, set env['firebug.logs'] to a list of pairs. The first element 
in each pair should be the log level: :info, :warn, :debug or :error. 
The second element should be the message.

For example

env['firebug.logs'] = [[:info, "beginning"]]
env['firebug.logs'] << [:error, "something went wrong"]
